# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my (still in progress) portfolio! 🚀  

This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiments in web development.  

## 🔧 Built With
- **React** – Frontend framework for building dynamic user interfaces  
- **Vite** – Fast development build tool  
- **JavaScript** – Core programming language

## 🎨 Future Enhancements
I plan to integrate **Three.js** and **React Three Fiber** to bring interactive 3D animations and immersive visuals to the portfolio.
